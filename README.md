# Debcraft: Easy, fast and secure way to build Debian packages

* **Easy**: Build any Debian/Ubuntu package in one single command. If you don't
  have the package or source already downloaded, it will be done automatically.
  Also, a build container (both Podman and Docker supported) is automatically
  built using the target Debian or Ubuntu suite in `debian/changelog` and with
  exact build dependencies from `debian/control`. Users are spared from having
  to manually prepare ahead or maintain [sbuild](https://wiki.debian.org/sbuild)
  root file systems or alike. The command output is (relatively) easy to read,
  and it also teaches users about Debian packaging in context.

* **Fast**: Container layer caching is utilized to make builds and re-builds
  blazingly fast. Debian packages that support [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) build
  even faster.

* **Secure**: Builds happen inside hermetic containers with no network access.
  This ensures all dependencies are properly managed and the built binaries
  equally trustworthy as the source code it was built from. This also protects
  the host system from getting polluted with extra development libraries, and
  adds an extra layer of protection to prevent anything malicious in the source
  code from accessing secrets on the host system. The additional logs provided
  by Debcraft also helps audit changes in Debian package sources and build
  artifacts.

> **Feedback welcome!** Debcraft is still in early development and your feedback is greatly appreciated. Bug reports at https://salsa.debian.org/otto/debcraft/-/issues are welcome on for example:
>
> * Documentation: Is it easy to start using Debcraft? How could the documentation be clarified further?
> * Structure: Are you able to productively use Debcraft? Is the tool easy to reason about? Do the features and code architecture make sense?
> * Compatibility: Does Debcraft work on your laptop and with your favorite Linux distro / release / package?

## Usage

### Typical usage examples

#### Build a package straight from Debian unstable

```shell
debcraft build <package>
```

#### Build package from a specific Debian/Ubuntu release

```shell
debcraft build --distribution bullseye <package>
```

#### Build from a local directory

```shell
debcraft build <path to sources>
```

#### Drop into a shell inside the build container for debugging

```shell
debcraft shell <path to sources>
```

#### Build and ensure all dependencies are latest possible

```shell
debcraft build --pull <path to sources>
```

#### Build and publish to Launchpad Personal Package Archive (PPA)

```shell
DEBCRAFT_PPA=ppa:otto/ppa debcraft release <path to sources>
```

#### Pass build options to build

```shell
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=4 nocheck noautodbgsym" debcraft build <package>
```

### Command reference

```
$ debcraft --help
usage: debcraft [options] <build|validate|release|shell|prune> [<path|pkg|srcpkg|dsc|git-url>]

Debcraft is a tool to easily build .deb packages. The 'build' argument accepts
as a subargument any of:
  * path to directory with program sources including a debian/ subdirectory
    with the Debian packaging instructions
  * path to a .dsc file and source tarballs that can be built into a .deb
  * Debian package name, or source package name, that apt can download
  * git http(s) or ssh url that can be downloaded and built

The commands 'validate' and 'release' are intended to be used to finalilze
a package build. The command 'shell' can be used to pay around in the container
and 'prune' will clean up temporary files by Debcraft.

In addition to parameters below, anything passed in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS will also
be honored (currently DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=4 nocheck noautodbgsym').
Note that Debcraft builds never runs as root, and thus packages with
DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT are not supported.

optional arguments:
  --build-dirs-path    Path for writing build files and arfitacs (default: parent directory)
  --distribution       Linux distribution to build in (default: debian:sid)
  --container-command  container command to use (default: podman)
  --pull               ensure container base is updated
  --clean              ensure and sources are clean
  -h, --help           display this help and exit
  --version            display version and exit

## Installation

For the time being, Debcraft is not available in the Debian repositories or even
as a package at all. To use it, simply clone the git repository and link the
script from any directory you have in your `$PATH`, such as `$HOME/bin`

```
git clone
cd debcraft
ln -s ${PWD}/debcraft.sh ~/bin/debcraft
```

### Debian package

Debcraft is available on Debian unstable since July 2024. Install it with:

```
apt install --yes debcraft
```

If you do not have Podman nor Docker installed, it will install Podman by default.

## Development

### Design tenets

The core design principles are:
1. **Be opinionated, make the correct thing automatically** without asking user to make too many decisions, and when full automation is not possible, steer users to follow the best practices in software development.
2. Use [git](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/git), [git-buildpackage](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/git-buildpackage) and [quilt](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/quilt) as Debian is on a path to standardize on them as shown by the [Debian Trends website](https://trends.debian.net/).
3. **Use Linux containers** (not chroot like traditional Debian tools do) for improved isolation, security and reproducibility.
4. **Create build environment containers on the fly** so users don't need to plan ahead what containers or chroots to have.
5. **Be extremely fast** in what users are likely to spend most of their time on: rebuilds.
6. **Store logs and artifacts from builds and help users review changes** between builds and package versions to maximize users' understanding of how their changes affect the outcome.
7. **Don't expect users to run the latest version of Debian** or even Debian or Ubuntu at all. The barrier to run Debcraft should be as low as possible, so that anyone can participate in debugging Debian package builds and improving them.
8. **Encourage users to collaborate** and submit improvements upstream and on Salsa instead of just making their own private Debian packages.
9. **Teach users about the Debian policy** gradually and in context, so that over time users grow towards Debian maintainership.

### Development as an open source project

**This project is open source and contributions are welcome!** The project

maintains a promise that the initial review will happen in 48h for all Merge
Requests received. The [code review will be conducted professionally]() and the
code base aims to maintain a very high quality bar, so please reserve time to
polish your code submission in a couple of review rounds.

The project is hosted at https://salsa.debian.org/otto/debcraft with mirrors at
https://gitlab.com/ottok/debcraft and https://github.com/ottok/debcraft.

### Roadmap

Debcraft does not intend to replace well working existing tools like
[git-buildpackage](https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/),
but rather build upon them, making the overall process of as easy as possible.
**Current development focus is to make the `debcraft build` as easy and
efficient as possible** and it is already quite capable. The `release` is also
already fully usable.

The `validate` command only does static testing for the source directory without
modifying anything. Something like `polish` to run
[lintian-brush](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/lintian-brush/lintian-brush.1.en.html)
and other tools to automatically improve the package source code might be added
later, or a command to run dynamic tests on the built binaries (create local
repo, run piuparts, autopkgtests, some of the Salsa-CI tests locally etc).

The `prune` command currently does nothing.

To help Debian Developers with recurring work, a command such as `update` to
automatically import a new upstream version might also be implemented later.

Search for `@TODO` comments in the sources to see which parts are incomplete and
pending to be written out.

### Programming language: Bash

Bash was specifically chosen as the main language for this tool in order to keep
the code contribution barrier as low as possible. Additionally, as Debcraft
mainly builds upon invoking other programs via their command-line interface,
using Bash scripting helps keep the code base small and lean compared to using a
proper programming language to run tens of subshells. If the limitations of Bash
(e.g. lack of proper testing framework, limited control of output with merely
ANSI codes, overly simplistic error handling etc) starts to feel limiting, parts
of this tool might be rewritten in a fast to develop language like Python, Mojo,
Nim, Zig or Rust.

Note that Bash is used to its fullest. There is no need to restrict
functionality to POSIX compatibility as Debcraft will always run on Linux using
Linux containers anyway.

### High quality, secure and performant code

Despite being written with Bash, Debcraft still aims to highest possible code
quality by enforcing that the code base in Shellcheck clean along with other
applicable static testing, such as spellchecking. While running `set -e` is in
effect to stop execution on any error unless explicitly handled.

The Bash code should avoid spawning subshells if it can be avoided. For example
us in-line [Bash parameter
substitution](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html) instead
of spawning `sed` commands in subshells.

There are no fixed release dates or fixed milestone scopes. Maintaining high
quality trumps other priorities. This tool is intended to automate Debian
packaging work that has existed for decades, and the tools should be robust
enough to stand the test of time and serve for decades to come.

### Prioritize readability

It is more important for code to be easy to read and reason about than quick to
write. Therefore, always spend a bit of extra effort to make things clear and
easy to read. For example, write `--parameter` instead of just `-p` when
possible. Most commands are also run with `--verbose` intentionally to expose to
users what is happening.

Automation in a developer tool does not mean that things should be hidden - in
this tool automation is transparent, doing as much as possible on behalf of the
user but still transparent about what is being done.

### Testing

To help with ensuring the above about code quality, the project has both GitLab
CI for automatic testing and a simple `make test` command to run the same
testing locally while developing.

### Name

Why the name _Debcraft_? Because the name _debuild_ was already taken. The
'craft' also helps setting users in the correct mindset, hinting towards that
producing high quality Debian packages and maintaining operating system over
many years and decades is not just a pure technical task, but involves following
industry wisdoms, anticipating unknowns and hand-crafting and tuning things to
be as perfect as possible.
