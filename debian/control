Description: Easy, fast and secure way to build Debian packages
 Debcraft is a tool to build Debian packages as easily as possible. It uses
 Podman/Docker to automatically create a hermetic network-less build container
 based on the distribution defined in the source package debian/changelog with
 the dependencies defined in debian/control. Users don't need to manually create
 nor update root filesystems. If there is no source package, Debcraft will even
 automatically download it.
 .
 Thanks to efficient caching rebuilds are blazing fast, and additional logs make
 it easy to see what changed in the end result between each build.
 .
 The tool is fully written in Bash, so reasoning about how it works is easy. It
 does not even need to run on Debian as all builds happen inside containers.
