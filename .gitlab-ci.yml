## Debian testing
# Once 'make test' passed, also run the .deb builds and tests
# @NOTE: This is likely to work well only on salsa.debian.org as the Gitlab.com
# runners are too small for everything this stage does.

#   stage: Salsa-CI
#   trigger:
#     include: debian/salsa-ci.yml

## Security testing
# You can override the included template(s) by including variable overrides
